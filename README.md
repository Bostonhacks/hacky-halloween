# hacky-halloween

This is the source code for the halloween puzzle challenge at BostonHacks Fall 2017 (10/28 - 10/29).

For an explanation of the puzzle solutions/recap, check out the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MUforagruYkoIfqLyJbTNRLjlpIBpLX7KZwaCljWlKo/edit?usp=sharing)

I am slowly collecting all the files needed to complete the challenge and will upload to this repo soon :)
